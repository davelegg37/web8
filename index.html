		<div>Description of Game and How to Play
You have to save the man trapped in the web of oil. To do this you mustremove four of the web’s strands by giving up  the stuff which created the web.How to give  up your stuff:  Start game with 20 units of stuff.  The more stuff you give up the greater the odds of removing the strands. (when you remove a strand the black strand will disappear)  Each time you fail to remove a strand you move closer to doomsday and your man (human        population) declines until there is no longer a sustainable human society.  Game ends whenYou reach doomsdayYou run out of stuffYou remove four strands from the webTHE GAME MAY NOT BE WINNABLE

		<div>Transportation- cars,planes,trains,boats, they all use oil based fuel even electric vehicles have to be charged.
Transportation infrastructure -   Cars need highways, bridges gas stations.  Planes need airports. Trains need tracks and stations Even ships need ports.
Energy - Most of the energy we consume comes from fossil fuels
Energy infrastructure - digging, drilling, pumping, transporting, grids, dynamos,
Agriculture. - Plowing, planting, fertilizing, harvesting, selling, all use oil
Agriculture infrastructure- Big farms, big markets, farms far from tables requiring transportation.
Structures residential-Big houses far from workplace, shopping, friends and family

		<div>“It is worse, much worse, than you think. The slowness of climate change is a fairy tale, perhaps as pernicious as the one that says it isn’t happening at all, and comes to us bundled with several others in an anthology of comforting delusions: that global warming is an Arctic saga, unfolding remotely; that it is strictly a matter of sea level and coastlines, not an enveloping crisis sparing no place and leaving no life undeformed; that it is a crisis of the “natural” world, not the human one; “.   David Wallace Wells
